					J. C. Leyendecker is one of the most iconic American Illustrators from the early 20th Century. 
						He is known for his commercial illustration works done for Saturday Evening Post, Arrow Collars, Collierâ€™s and so on. 
						<br><br>
						He developed his own unique style and created iconic imageries. He also influenced many illustration artists, 
						including Normal Rockwell, who is also well known American illustrator. 
						<br><br>
						This website is demonstrating at showing the multiple perspectives of his works, process and its effect on current day. 
						It is my own interpretation of his work and a visual archive of his works.
