			<h1>Leyendecker Archive</h1>

			<p>J. C. Leyendecker is one of the most iconic American Illustrators from the early 20th Century. He is known for his commercial illustration works done for Saturday Evening Post, Arrow Collars, Collierâ€™s and so on. He developed his own unique style and created iconic imageries. He also influenced many illustration artists, including Normal Rockwell, who is also well known American illustrator. </p>
			<p>This website is demonstrating at showing the multiple perspectives of his works, process and its effect on current day. It is my own interpretation of his work and a visual archive of his works.</p>

			<p> "One can often work directly from the model, whereas a cover requires more careful planning and should be designed to fill a given space on the order of a decoration. My first step is to fill a sketchpad with a number of small rough sketches about two by three inches, keeping them on one sheet so you can compare them at a glance. Select the one that seems to tell the story most clearly and adding more detail and color as needed. "</p>
