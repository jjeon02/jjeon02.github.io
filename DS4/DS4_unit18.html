                It was a discussion from one of the classes from sophomore year. We talked about art schools around the world. The discussion flowed into the direction of how their education is heavily influenced by the ‘Western’ idea of art. I definitely agree with the fact that the art field in general, including the art world from non-European countries, has a tendency of being Eurocentric. However, at that moment, I had to question myself: what even is Korean experience?

                While I was living in Korea, I grew up wearing jeans and jackets instead of 
                <a href="https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/AKR/AK_ENG_2_2.jsp" target=_blank class="link">hanbok</a>. 
                Because I like Korean food – including kimchi, as stereotypical as it sounds– didn’t mean I didn’t have access to McDonald's. I started learning the English alphabet when I was 5. I was surrounded by 
                <span class="fusion">both Korean and somewhat weird English</span> 
                – often times 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konglish" target=_blank class="link">Konglish</a>. 
                Even at this moment, I’m writing this article while typing my laptop keyboard which has both Korean and English.

                Of course, Korean culture is quite different from the American one. And as an international student, I don’t want to speak like I’m completely understanding American culture and life. Still, it doesn’t mean I didn’t have any access to American news, art, and culture, for example like watching Disney films from Netflix. 
                <br><br>
                In previous University, there were only two art majors. It was industrial design and 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_art" targer=_blank class="link">Korean art</a>, 
                and I chose an industrial design since I figured I wouldn’t be able to handle fine art. Industrial design students learned Eurocentric art education including Bauhaus. I actually learned more non-European artworks and artists from RISD. In Industrial Design class we mentioned Walter Gropius, Karim Rashid, Dieter Rams, Philippe Starck and so on. Two majors really didn’t have anything in common besides the mandatory 1st-year classes. 
                <br><br>
                The ‘Korean’ education I remember the most is the mandatory Korean art class I took in 1st year, which was quite superficial. And also there was one professor who argued the importance of Asian art and explained how the Beatles were influenced by Indian music and Steve Jobs taught employees calligraphy to make iPhone. I don’t even know where to start.

            At this point, is it even possible to escape global influence, as a millennial from one of the most westernized 1st world country? Even the term we use for design (디자인) is a literal pronunciation of the English term.

            I still managed to take classes like “History of Korean Design”. Things I learned from that class is that 
            <span class="fusion">every Korean Design is a copycat of something</span>
             and a poor revision of Korean culture. Korean designers copied everything — we copied posters, mascots, industrial designs and so on. We copied things without deep understandings, including our own tradition. We used things from the past that seems ‘traditional’ without deep research and reason behind it. It was fusion. And this problem still continues. 
            <br><br>
            “Fusion”’(퓨전 pyu-jeon) was one of the most common terms I could hear in Korea. It was often used in negative notation, especially when explaining 
            <a href="fusion2.html">
                <span class="fusion">the revival or mix of Korean Tradition in a weird way</span>. 
            </a>
            For example: When we built an art center based on traditional novel men’s hat; When we tried to create Kimchi chocolate; When we tried to create Kimchi-theme cartoon. At this point, I questioned, what’s with all this obsession with Kimchi?

            However, the professor from “History of Korean Design” also suggested— without those processes and period of weird products, there is no way we could create good designs. And those products of “fusion” of culture was mostly, accessible to a wide range of audiences, and I agree on that aspect. Although I still disagree on many Korean fusion architectures and monuments built by Korean governmental authorizations, I still agree on the trial. There’s can’t be good results without multiple bad results. And the process is never simple clean or organized—it’s chaotic.
            <br><br>
            In “fusion”, there is no such originality or purity. What we were trying to achieve was all about somewhat cleaned out fusion that is actually functional. Even though we failed kimchi chocolate, we still managed to come up with kimchi fried rice with cheese on top. 
            <br><br>
            At this moment there is no point in such “reviving the past”. Of course, we have to study what exactly was it like in the past. Still, that does not mean we can’t ignore the fact that we are living in a mixed-up environment. And I believe this concept of “Chaotic Fusion” can be applied to every random thing — art, music, theory, food … and probably 
            <span class="fusion">meme</span>.
