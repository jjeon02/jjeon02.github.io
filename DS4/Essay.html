	    			<p>It was a discussion from one of the classes from sophomore year. We talked about art schools around the world. The discussion flowed into the direction of how educations from Non-European countries are heavily influenced by the ‘Western’ idea of art. I definitely agree with the fact that the art field in general, including the art world outside the United States and Europe, has a tendency of being Eurocentric. </p>

Of course, Korean culture is quite different from the American one. And as an international student, I don’t want to speak like I’m completely understanding American culture and life. Still, it doesn’t mean I didn’t have any access to American news, art, and culture. Not to mention Korea have been heavily influenced by politics, military and economy of the United States. <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20160511002300320" targer=_blank> For some reason we even have a Trump tower. </a>

	    				In previous University, there were only two art majors. It was industrial design and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_art" target=_blank>Korean art</a>, and I chose an industrial design since I figured I wouldn’t be able to handle fine art. Industrial design students learned Eurocentric art education including Bauhaus. In the class we mentioned Walter Gropius, Karim Rashid, Dieter Rams, Philippe Starck and so on.

And also there was one professor who argued the importance of Asian art and explained how the Beatles were influenced by Indian music and Steve Jobs taught employees calligraphy to make iPhone. I don’t even know where to start to criticize.

		    				<p style="color:white">
		    				During the time when the Korean government focused on economic growth, they also invested in creating good Korean artistic contents, including design. However, Korea did not have enough education system and people who had professional design training. Combined with the lack of recognition for copyrights, Korea plagiarized lots of design from outside the country, especially Japan.
		    				<br><br>
		    				Japan was one of the closest countries to Korea, not only geologically but also in terms of cultural familiarity. One of the most iconic examples is “Robot Taegwon V”, the iconic Korean cartoon of all time. Not only the concept of humanoid giant robot controlled by a person was similar, but the design was obviously similar to the Japanese animation “Mazinga-Z”, which was the most problematic one.
		    				<br><br>
							Plagiarism did not end on a cartoon character, but also on posters, icons, products, snack packaging, movies, music and so on. This is still continued today, and still, a problem that we have to face.
							<br><br>
		    				The work itself is self-reflective to plagiarism. It’s plagiarizing plagiarized artworks, focusing on one of the most iconic cultural phenomenon and most iconic plagiarism – Robot Taegwon V. My main robot character is Robot Copycat K. It carries around a paper cutting knife, and it’s controlled by a graphic design student to defeat bad graphic designs around the world.</p>

				During the colonization and influences from the outside world, Korea was also influenced by orientalism point of view. One of the common examples is a Korean travel advertisement poster from the 70s. Lots of travel poster promoting Korean culture focuses on the tradition from old times, which did not reflect how Korea actually looked like during that time.
				In the 70s, Korea was quite westernized and did not have those ‘traditional lifestyle’
				 <br></br>
				Even the use of obangsaek (오방색) which is meant to be iconic colors that represent Korea, is also a result of Korean politic. During the Park Jung-hee dictatorship from the 70s, obangsaek was considered to be a color of “primitive” Korean Shamanism and should be avoided. The obangsaek revived during the 80s when former president Jeon Do-Hwan dictatorship happened.  Tradition is always determined and filtered by politics and chosen by people from the current time.
				 <br><br>
				In modern times, Korea seems to focus on somewhat more of modern ideology ­– k-pop, technology, a view of skyscraper right beside cultural heritage. Thanks to Youtube, modern culture like Gangnam style and fire noodle could become famous all over the world. However, when seeing things like I seoul u –One of the most weird catchphrase ever made–, it seems like we still need progress on shaping our own image.

    				<p>However, the professor from “History of Korean Design” also suggested— without those processes and period of weird products, there is no way we could create good designs. And those products of “fusion” of culture was mostly, accessible to a wide range of audiences, and I agree on that aspect. Although I still disagree on many Korean fusion architectures and monuments built by Korean governmental authorizations, I still agree on the trial. There’s can’t be good results without multiple bad results. And the process is never simple clean or organized—it’s chaotic. </p>

    			<h2>In “fusion”, there is no such originality or purity. What we were trying to achieve was all about somewhat cleaned out fusion that is actually functional.</h2>
    			<p>At this moment there is no point in such “reviving the past”. Of course, we have to study what exactly was it like in the past. Still, that does not mean we can’t ignore the fact that we are living in a mixed-up environment. </p>

    			<h2>I believe this concept of “Chaotic Fusion” can be applied to every random thing — art, music, theory, food … and probably Bonobono – yes, the anime character.</h2>

    			<h2>The story of bonobono</h2>
    			<p>
    				I wanted to introduce this iconic anime character, which became one of the most iconic Korean meme. It started from one university student’s powerpoint slide. He made the slide that has too much content in one page and put bono-bono illustration, which had no relation to the content. 
    				<br><br>
					The meme started from the capture of kakaotalk chat. Basically, the teammate scolded the person who made the slide and instructed him to how to fix the slide, including using the term “Get rid of god damn Bonobono”
					<br><br>
					The term “God Damn Bonobono(좇같은 보노보노)” and the picture of Bonobono slide became the most iconic example of bad graphic design. Bonobono meme became famous and dozens of variations were created, just like any famous meme. This person, attempted on good slide template out of bonobono illustration. This meme not only stayed inside internet, it became the greeting poster for Visual Design major in Hong-ik University – which is considered to be one of the best universities for art and design – and became a skit for comedy show. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVlTaMfT6KA
					<br><br>
					In coincidence, I happened to find this Youtube video that interviewed the person who made the bono bono slide, and this made me rethink this project. Obviously the reason this person put Bonobono was he was using Bonobono as username on that time – so not really serious reason. Obviously, after he got a harsh critic he changed the design into clearer version. But on the internet the previous Bonobono version as shown as “after fixing” and fixed version was shown as “before fixing”. Even though he requested the person who uploaded the wrong information with the picture of slide to put it down, the person who uploaded the slide screen did not fixed it. The chat capture was also uploaded out of his consent.
