	    				Historically, Korean culture was heavily influenced by countries around the peninsula. China, Mongolia, Japan and also, the United States. Of course, Korean culture is quite different from the American one. And as an international student, I don’t want to speak like I’m completely understanding American culture and life. Still, it doesn’t mean I didn’t have any access to American news, art, and culture. <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20160511002300320" targer=_blank>We even have a Trump tower. </a>

	    			<h2>Between Two Languages</h2>
	    			<p> I started learning the English alphabet when I was 5. I was always surrounded by both Korean and somewhat weird English – often times <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konglish">Konglish</a>. At this moment, I’m writing this article while typing my laptop keyboard which has both Korean and English alphabets.</p>
	    			<br><br>
	    			<p>Despite the cultural, formal and grammatic differences between two languages and its alphabets, often times it was written at the same time. A lot of times Korean texts are written together with English translation. And modern Korean itself also uses lots of English originated terms and words and often time English text is written in the middle of Korean text.</p>
	 				<br><br>
	 				<p>
					This work is a reflection on how Korean and English are used together. <br>The key to translation is right in front of you.

	    				In previous University, there were only two art majors. It was industrial design and Korean art, and I chose an industrial design since I figured I wouldn’t be able to handle fine art. Industrial design students learned Eurocentric art education including Bauhaus. In the class we mentioned Walter Gropius, Karim Rashid, Dieter Rams, Philippe Starck and so on.

	    				The ‘Korean’ education I remember the most is the mandatory Korean art class I took in 1st year, which was quite superficial. And also there was one professor who argued the importance of Asian art and explained how the Beatles were influenced by Indian music and Steve Jobs taught employees calligraphy to make iPhone. I don’t even know where to start.

		    				<p style="color:white">
		    				During the time when the Korean government focused on economic growth, they also invested in creating good Korean artistic contents, including design. However, Korea did not have enough education system and people who had professional design training. Combined with the lack of recognition for copyrights, Korea plagiarized lots of design from outside the country, especially Japan.
		    				<br><br>
		    				Japan was one of the closest countries to Korea, not only geologically but also in terms of cultural familiarity. One of the most iconic examples is “Robot Taegwon V”, the iconic Korean cartoon of all time. Not only the concept of humanoid giant robot controlled by a person was similar, but the design was obviously similar to the Japanese animation “Mazinga-Z”, which was the most problematic one.
		    				<br><br>
							Plagiarism did not end on a cartoon character, but also on posters, icons, products, snack packaging, movies, music and so on. This is still continued today, and still, a problem that we have to face.
							<br><br>
		    				The work itself is self-reflective to plagiarism. It’s plagiarizing plagiarized artworks, focusing on one of the most iconic cultural phenomenon and most iconic plagiarism – Robot Taegwon V. My main robot character is Robot Copycat K. It carries around a paper cutting knife, and it’s controlled by a graphic design student to defeat bad graphic designs around the world.</p>

				During the colonization and influences from the outside world, Korea was also influenced by orientalism point of view. One of the common examples is a Korean travel advertisement poster from the 70s. Lots of travel poster promoting Korean culture focuses on the tradition from old times, which did not reflect how Korea actually looked like during that time.
				In the 70s, Korea was quite westernized and did not have those ‘traditional lifestyle’
				 
				Even the use of obangsaek (오방색) which is meant to be iconic colors that represent Korea, is also a result of Korean politic. During the Park Jung-hee dictatorship from the 70s, obangsaek was considered to be a color of “primitive” Korean Shamanism and should be avoided. The obangsaek revived during the 80s when former president Jeon Do-Hwan dictatorship happened.  Tradition is always determined and filtered by politics and chosen by people from the current time.
				 
				In modern times, Korea seems to focus on somewhat more of modern ideology ­– k-pop, technology, a view of skyscraper right beside cultural heritage. Thanks to Youtube, modern culture like Gangnam style and fire noodle could become famous all over the world. However, when seeing things like I seoul u –One of the most weird catchphrase ever made–, it seems like we still need progress on shaping our own image.
